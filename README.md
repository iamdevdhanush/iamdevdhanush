## 🧭 What I'm Doing in 2026

- 📌 Contributing on GitHub **every day**
- 📌 Learning DevOps by **breaking and fixing real systems**
- 📌 Focusing on fundamentals before scale
- 📌 Documenting everything I learn (including mistakes)

This profile is a **work log**, not a highlight reel.

## 🧠 DevOps Mindset

- Logs over guessing  
- Automation over repetition
