# Dhanush

DevOps-focused learner building reliability through practice, not hype.

## What I'm Doing
I’m spending 2026 doing one thing consistently:
**building, breaking, fixing, and automating systems in public.**

This GitHub is a logbook, not a portfolio showcase.

---

## Current Focus
- Linux internals & system behavior
- Shell scripting and automation
- Git & GitHub workflows
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Docker fundamentals
- Cloud basics (AWS – free tier)
- Monitoring & logs (early stage)

---

## How I Work
- I break systems on purpose
- I read logs before Googling
- I automate before repeating
- I document failures and fixes
- I commit daily — no zero days

If it’s not reproducible, it’s not learning.

---

## What You'll Find Here
- Small, focused DevOps experiments
- CI/CD pipelines and configs
- Dockerfiles and infra drafts
- Scripts that remove manual work
- Mistakes with written post-mortems

Progress > polish.

---

## Principles
- Consistency beats motivation
- Simple systems scale better
- Automation is respect for time
- Monitoring is not optional

---

I’m not here to look impressive.  
I’m here to become **useful in production environments**.
